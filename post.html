                    <p>The first computer science class I ever took was here at Wheaton College in Norton, MA. It was called COMP-115: Robots, Games, and Problem Solving. With Professor Armstrong as my first computer science teacher, I had a friendly but humorous introduction to Wheaton College's computer science department. Python was the first programming language I ever learned and it was all very challenging but fun for me. However, prior to this class, I had absolutely no clue as to what computer science even was! Can't even begin to think of what that would be like now.....</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Experience at the time:</h2>

                    <p>Well in high school, I took one class on how to use Microsoft Office. We did things like learn how to make powerpoints and mathematical calculations using spreadsheets. That's computer science right? I have experience right?</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">WRONG.</h2>

                    <p>I knew absolutely NOTHING. And I didn't quite understand what I was taught at first either. In fact, I feel as if it took me two years to have a general grasp and understanding on the very general subject of computer science. Even in the introductory class of COMP-115 I still struggled with understanding various concepts that were taught to me, but one thing I did realize was how much I enjoyed succeeding in writing code that worked and solved a problem that I was aiming at.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">So what?</h2>

                    <p>That enjoyment I just mentioned! That's what got me into computer science; it felt very rewarding, even at a basic level. Because of COMP-115, I opened up to a whole new subject that I never even took a second to think about. With a sparked curiousity and desire to learn more, I advanced to where I am today!</p>
